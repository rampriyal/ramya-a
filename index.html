<h1>zinc deficiency in maize</h1>
<h3><marquee  style="background-color:powderblue;">monitor your maize plants for zinc deficiency</marquee></h3>
<h2 style="color:blue;">symptoms</h2>
<p><ul>Zinc deficiency in maize can cause a variety of symptoms, including:<br> 
<br><ul><li>Yellow or white streaks: Leaves may have yellow or white streaks or bands between the veins, or a white band that runs from the base to the tip of the leaf.</li> 
<li>White new leaves: New leaves may be white in color, also known as "white bud".</li> 
<li>Shortened internodes: Internode growth is reduced, which can lead to a stunted appearance.</li> 
<li>Reddish or necrotic discoloration: In severe cases, the leaf margins and stems may develop a reddish to necrotic brown discoloration.</li> 
<li>Necrotic spots: At an advanced stage of zinc deficiency, leaves may develop necrotic spots.</li></ul><br> 
<ul>Zinc is an essential microelement for plants, and it's important to identify deficiencies early to prevent extensive damage. Zinc deficiency can be made worse by: Organic soils, High pH soils, Soils rich in phosphorus, and Cold wet conditions.</ul> </ul></p>
<h2 style="color:blue;">causes</h2><ul>Zinc deficiency in maize can be caused by a variety of factors, including:</ul> 
<h3 style="color:red;">Soil conditions</h3>
<ul>Zinc deficiency can be common in many types of soil, including sandy soils, organic soils, and soils with high pH levels. Soils with low organic matter or compacted soils can also be at risk for zinc deficiency.</ul> 
<h3 style="color:red;">Phosphorus levels</h3>
<ul>High levels of phosphorus in the soil or high rates of phosphorus fertilization can cause zinc deficiency, especially in soils with marginal zinc levels.</ul> 
<h3 style="color:red;">Cold, wet conditions</h3>
<ul>Cold, wet soil conditions can limit the growth of corn roots and the availability of zinc.</ul> 
<h3 style="color:red;">Liming</h3>
<ul>Liming soils can increase zinc sorption and cause zinc deficiency.</ul>
<h2 style="color:blue;">management</h2> 
<ul><li>Test soil for zinc levels one to two months before planting.</li> 
<li>Apply zinc sulfate at a rate of 1.6 kg Zn/acre before planting. You can also apply zinc as a starter at a rate of one to two pounds per acre, or as a broadcast application at a rate of five to 10 pounds per acre.</li> 
<li>Avoid over-applying phosphorus fertilizers, which can suppress zinc uptake.</li> 
<li>Apply a foliar chelate of zinc at a rate of 1.3 kg/120 L/acre, or Zinc Max 38 ml/100 L/acre.</li> 
<li>Apply organic manures like farmyard manure or green manure to provide organic matter.</li> 
<li>Use compost or mulch to preserve microorganisms that help release zinc.</li> 
<li>Rotate crops seasonally with plants that have a low zinc requirement, like wheat.</li> 
<li>Zinc may not correct zinc deficiency in alkaline soils because it may remain unavailable for plant absorption.</li></ul>
